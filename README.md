Symfony Basic Install
========================

I'm tired of forgetting how to setup symfony2 to create quick projects, so I thought I'd setup this basic thing to get up and running quick.

It contains:

  - Bootstrap and a basic layout.html.twig
  - Angular.js
  - jQuery.js


# Installation
Simply clone this, or copy it, then delete the .git so you can create a new git repo.
